*** intro
J-ArrayFire cd bindings - https://arrayfire.org

arrayfire backend must be initialized before it can be used
 cpu    - always available and uses cpu memory and cores
 opencl - always available (arrayfire includes it) - uses available hardware
 cuda   - available if you have cuda software and suitable hardware installed

   init_jaf_'cpu'   NB. 'cpu' or 'cuda' or 'opencl'

   tut_jaf_ ''      NB. list tutorials
   tut_jaf_ 'basic' NB. run basic
   
   man_jaf_''       NB. man pages

*** tutorials
   tut_jaf_''            NB. list tutorials
   tut_jaf_'basic'       NB. run basic

*** change backend
you can switch to another backend
   freeall_jaf_''    NB. release storage in current backend
   close_jaf_''      NB. allow init of new backend
   init_jaf_'opencl'

*** tests
tutorial scripts also serve as tests

   load  JAFP,'/tutorial/basic.ijs' NB. run basic - check for errors
   loadd JAFP,'/tutorial/basic.ijs' NB. run basic with display
   loadd (<JAFP,'/tutorial/'),each tuts_jaf_,each<'.ijs' NB. run all 

*** benchmarks
   study files in folder: JAFP,'bench'

*** row major vs col major
J array is row major - AF array is column major
 af_create_array creates an AF array with verb rcc
 get reads the array back with an rcc inverse
 J data to set AF array with (i.2 3) is: 0 3 1 4 2 5

browse: https://arrayfire.org/docs/classaf_1_1array.htm
 and searchfor: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
 to see how host data (raveled row major order) populates an AF array
 and to understand why rcc is necessary

*** bugs
sparse
 display/af_print_array sparse array messes up ref counts

*** utils
util/util.ijs tools that create files from c headers
 families.ijs     - J cd  bindings for families of routines
 util/proto.txt   - all arrayfire c protypes
 util/famcnts.txt - count and 1st member of each family with same prototype

*** install arrayfire
you need to have arrayfire installed
 https://arrayfire.org
  download installer and follow the instructions

Windows: ArrayFire v3.8.0 (Cuda 10.1)
 depends on normal install that:
  adds path to install folder to PATH env var 
  sets path to install folder in AF_PATH env var
 default install: C:\Program Files\ArrayFire\v?

Linux:
 ldconfig steps are important!
 default install: /opt/arrayfire

MacOS:
 default install: /opt/arrayfire
 alternatively install via homebrew
 $ brew install arrayfire

loading arraryfire.ijs sets libtemplate for loading the library
 after load, and before init, you could change libtemplate if required

test the installation with J
   load'~addons/math/arrayfire.ijs'
   man_jaf_
   init_jaf_'cpu'
   ...
   
you can also build and run the arrayfire tests
 but these can be complicated and may require cuda

*** install cuda
cuda (Nvidia gpu toolkit) requires suitable Nvidia hardware
 and complicated cuda software install

you can do a lot with arrayfire with cpu backend
 you to NOT need Nvidia hardware/software to use arrayfire

https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/
 
information from use install experience is required here

*** credits
Pascal Jasmin was the J-ArrayFire pioneer in 2015 with
 https://github.com/Pascal-J/Jfire
 
Alex Shroyer, in late 2021, did some new work and wrote a paper:
 https://alexshroyer.com/papers/matmul_j_gpu.pdf

this addon started with a clean slate - it might be interesting 
 to see if it could be improved/replaced by the work of Pascal or Alex
 
*** preload
some linux distributions have a mismatch with libraries required by arrayfire
web search: MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avxavx2.so or libmkl_def.so

export LD_PRELOAD to load required libs before starting J is a workaround

* afrunjhs.sh - script to run JHS with preload
#!/bin/bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/opt/arrayfire/lib64/libmkl_def.so:/opt/arrayfire/lib64/libmkl_avx2.so:/opt/arrayfire/lib64/libmkl_core.so:/opt/arrayfire/lib64/libmkl_intel_lp64.so:/opt/arrayfire/lib64/libmkl_intel_thread.so:/opt/arrayfire/lib64/libiomp5.so
